You need the QBCore Framework for the script to work.
Supported framework is [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core).

- Option to have a Discord Webhook where everyone on your discord can see who won.
- The script is made so that even a player who is not currently online on the server can win.
